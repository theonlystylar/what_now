DONE [1/18/2016] Figure out how to detect the environment name so we can do this in the startup.cs file:
		var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
            .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true);

		It's in the start up file for a new mvc project (not the empty one).  env.EnvironmentName comes from
		Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting.Abstractions assembly but it's not clear looking at the app how to reference it.
